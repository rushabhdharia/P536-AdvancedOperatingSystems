Note: I have submitted 2 files pargrep.c and pargrep2.c. pargrep2.c is the faster implementation which works on my PC running on Ubuntu. pargrep2.c does not run on silo. But when I use the debugger Valgrind on Silo it does show the output.
pargrep.c is the slower implementation which uses a lot of file i/o. The only difference in pargrep.c and pargrep2.c is the storage of output. pargrep.c stores output of each thread in files and pargrep2.c stores output in buffers.
Kindly consider pargrep2.c for grading. For the purpose of completion I have implemented pargrep.c which runs on Silo.

Q1) The concurrency design that you chose, and why.
Ans) 
Splitting of input file - The input file is split using - (total number of lines in file)/(number of threads)

How many threads to use - In pargrep the overhead of creating files is high therefore number of threads makes a lot of difference
In pargrep2 Amdahl's law can be observed as shown below. Therefore for a file of size 700KB ~ 1MB using 3-4 threads improves the performance by almost 50% 

Getting Output in Order - In pargrep I've saved the output of each pthread in different files and printing those files after pthread_join, i.e. after waiting for each thread to complete execution.
In pargrep2 I've saved the output of each pthread in different buffers and printing those buffers after pthread_join, i.e. after waiting for each thread to complete execution.


Q2) Compare performance with standard (non-parallel) grep changing the number of threads, etc.
